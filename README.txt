Title: Inventory Management System

Objective: I developed a software application as part of a school project using IntelliJ. The aim was to create an app that assists users in efficiently manage their inventory. With a user-friendly graphical interface, this JavaFX application provides a seamless experience for adding, modifying, deleting and searching parts and products.
